Knowing that a consumer's preferences can be represented by the
utility function $U (X, Y) = X ^ 2 Y$, fill in the missing data in the
following table:

Carlos's utility function is $U (X, Y) = X Y$. If he consumes the
basket $A$, consisting of 2 units of good $X$ and 10 units of good $Y$:

a) What would be the utility of Carlos? Would his utility increase if
   he got 1 more unit of $X$ in exchange for 2 units of $Y$?

b) Obtain and plot the indifference curve that contains the basket
   $A$.

c) How many units of good $Y$ would Carlos be willing to give up in
   exchange for an additional unit of good $X$?

\TASK Luna and Aurora are two sisters whose preferences are identical
and can be represented by the utility function: $U(X, Y) = 6 X + 3
Y$. Luna consumes the basket $L = (1, 5)$ while Aurora consumes the
basket $A = (3, 2)$.

a) Calculate the utility levels of Luna and Aurora.

b) Obtain the marginal rate of substitution for each sister.

c) Obtain and draw the indifference curves for Luna and Aurora.

 \DANGER Carmen collects old pictures. Today she went to a street
 market where she bought 50 pictures for her collection, and she has
 still \money{150} to purchase other things. In one of the stands in
 the street market she has found a set of 10 pictures she is
 interested in, for which \money{25} are asked. Carmenâ€™s utility
 function is:
 #+begin_export latex
 \[
   U(P, Y) = (P + 10) Y^{2}
 \]
 #+end_export
 where $P$ is the number of pictures she buys and $Y$ is a composite good.

 a) Will she buy the set of 10 pictures?

 b) How much will Carmen be willing to pay for $10$ additional
    pictures?
