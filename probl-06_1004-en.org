 Carmen collects old pictures. Today she has gone to a street market
 where she has bought 50 pictures for her collection, and she has

 the street market she has found a set of 10 pictures she is
 interested in, for which \money{25} are asked. Carmenâ€™s utility
 function is:
 #+begin_export latex
 \[
   U(P, Y) = (P + 10) Y^{2}
 \]
 #+end_export
 where $P$ is the number of pictures she buys and $Y$ is a composite good.

 a) Will she buy the set of 10 pictures?

 b) How much will Carmen be willing to pay for $10$ additional

Five friends have bought fruit and each one of them has obtained the
same combination: 3 apples and 6 pears. The price of an apple is
\money{1} whereas a pear costs \money{0.50}. The following table shows

consumers:

| Elaine       |  $6$       | $3$      |
| Kramer       |  $3$       | $6$      |
| Newman       | $12$       | $3$      |
|--------------+------------+----------|
