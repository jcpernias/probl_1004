* 1.1

An economy produces two goods, vehicles and food, using labor as
the only factor of production. There are \num{50000}Â labor hours
available. The following table shows how many units of each good
can be produced according to the labor hours devoted to each
activity:

a) Draw the Production Possibility Frontier, PPF.

b) What effect on the PPF would have an improvement on the
   procedures used in the production of food that raises the output
   per labor hour? And an organizational improvement in the
   production chain of vehicles? And what would happen if both
   improvements occur simultaneously as a result of a widespread
   technical progress?

c) Which would be the consequences on the PPF of the reduction of
   the labor hours by half as a result of an armed conflict?

The table below shows different efficient combinations for an
economy in which only two goods are produced: $X$ and $Y$.

a) Draw the PPF. What can be said about the particular shape of PPF?

b) Is it feasible to produce 2 units of $Y$ and 10 units of $X$?
   What happens in this situation?

c) Construct a table that reflects the opportunity cost of
   producing each unit of $Y$.

d) How many units of $X$ must be given up to produce the first
   unit of $Y$? And the second one?

e) What is the relationship between the PPF shape and the opportunity
   cost?

The following figure shows the production possibilities frontier of
an economy where only fish and coconuts are produced:

#+xxx: fig fig-probl-1_1004-ppf-*.pdf

Sort the production options $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ from higher to
lower opportunity cost of producing fish.


* 1.4

State whether the following sentence is true or false and justify your
answer: "When a great number of unemployed workers find a job, the
production possibilities frontier shifts to the right."
