1. There are three buyers in a market whose demand curves are:

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :center t :align lc
   | Buyer 1: | $Q^d_1(P) = 1000 - 10 P$ |
   | Buyer 2: | $Q^d_2(P) = 600 - 2 P$   |
   | Buyer 3: | $Q^d_3(P) = 750 - 5 P$   |

   Determine the market demand curve.

2. Consider a competitive market where \num{1000} identical buyers
   participate, each one with demand curve:
   #+begin_export latex
   \[
     Q^d_i(P) = 5 - P, \qquad i = 1, ..., \num{1000}.
   \]
   #+end_export
   There are also
   \num{625} identical firms, each one with supply curve:
   #+begin_export latex
   \[
     Q^o_j(P) = 2.4 P , \qquad j = 1, ..., \num{625}.
   \]
   #+end_export

   a) Find and plot the market equilibrium.

   b) What would happen if the price were \price{4}? And if the price
      were \price{1}?

3. "The price of gasoline considerably increased during the years from
   2003 to 2006, and yet the consumption of gasoline grew."  Does this
   claim contradict the law of demand?

4. Consider a competitive market for apples and draw a demand and
   supply diagram showing the effects on the equilibrium of an apple
   tree disease that adversely affects the harvest. Could farmers'
   revenues rise in that case? What conditions must be met?

5. A country is facing an increase in drug use. Experts have
   put forward two alternative explanations:

   - The decreasing police budget has led to an increase in drugs on
     the streets.

   - Cutbacks in education efforts have decreased awareness of the
     dangers of drug use.

   Use demand and supply diagrams to analyze each of these
   hypotheses. Is it possible to discern between the two explanations
   by observing what happened to the price and the consumption of drugs?

6. The demand and supply curves of the market for good $X$ are:
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{gather*}
     X^d = \num{85000} - 20 P_X \\
     X^o = \num{15000} + 15 P_X
   \end{gather*}
   #+end_export

   a) Determine the equilibrium price and quantity.

   b) Plot the effects on the market equilibrium of an increase in
      the price of a substituitive good. Is it possible to
      unequivocally predict how the equilibrium price of good $X$
      will change? And the equilibrium quantity?

   c) Starting from the initial equilibrium, consider now the effects
      of an increase in the consumers' income. Is it possible to
      unambiguously predict how the equilibrium price and quantity
      will change?

7. The electric car market of a country is competitive, and the
   demand and supply curves are:
   #+begin_export latex
   \begin{gather*}
     Q^{d} = \num{10000} - P/6 \\
     Q^{o} = -6000 + P/2
   \end{gather*}
   #+end_export

   a) Determine the equilibrium price and quantity.

   b) Find and plot the new equilibrium if demand increases by 20% (the
      quantity demanded is 20% greater at each price) and the supply
      curve becomes:
      #+begin_export latex
      \[
        Q^o = -2700 + P/2
      \]
      #+end_export

8. The market for an inferior good is in equilibrium. If production
   costs and consumer income increase simultaneously, will both the
   price and the quantity decrease in the new equilibrium?
